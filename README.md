# Create neural network from scratch
Creating a simple neural network in Python with one input layer (3 inputs) and one output neuron.
In the training.py I train the neural network in the clearest way possible, but it's not really useable.
neural_network.py is an object and can be used by giving in different inputs.

Run from main.py file
